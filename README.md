# changebot-trades
Enhanced trade log for Telegram Change Bot (BTC Banker, etc)

**Motivation**.
Change Bot produces a report with history of exchanges.
The report has simple csv format, which is not good enough to collect some usefull statistics: exchange amount per day, average exchange rate, etc.
**Changebot-trades** updates the report with several enhancements:
1. It converts report to xlsx (modern ms excel format).
2. It removes canceled trades.
2. It splits solid history to one-day groups.
3. It sums fiat for every one-day group.

**How to use**.
